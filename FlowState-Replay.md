# FlowState Replay

## Overview

FlowState Replay is Haevn's proprietary video capture and playback system that automatically records guests' surf sessions, allowing them to review, share, and analyze their performance. This feature transforms a momentary experience into lasting digital content, enhancing the overall value proposition of the adventure park.

## Business Rationale

* **Experience Enhancement**: Extends the value of a surf session beyond the physical experience
* **Social Sharing & Marketing**: User-shared content creates organic marketing and brand awareness
* **Retention Driver**: Motivates guests to return to track improvement over time
* **Premium Revenue**: Opportunity for upsell through advanced video features and packages
* **Competitive Advantage**: Differentiator from other adventure parks without sophisticated replay systems

## System Architecture

### Video Capture Infrastructure

* **Multi-Angle Camera Array**: Strategic placement of 4-8 cameras per surf area
* **Automated Tracking**: Computer vision algorithms that follow individual surfers
* **High-Frame-Rate Capture**: 60-120fps recording for smooth slow-motion playback
* **Water-Resistant Hardware**: Specialized equipment designed for water proximity
* **Local Edge Processing**: Initial video processing happens on-site to reduce latency

### Video Processing Pipeline

1. **Session Detection**: System identifies when a session begins/ends
2. **Surfer Tracking**: AI identifies and tracks individual surfers
3. **Clip Generation**: Automatic creation of highlight clips based on movement analysis
4. **Quality Enhancement**: Color correction, stabilization, and enhancement
5. **Metadata Attachment**: Session data, user info, and timestamps added
6. **Transcoding**: Conversion to multiple formats and resolutions for different devices
7. **Storage & Distribution**: Cloud storage with CDN distribution

### User Experience Flow

1. **Pre-Session**: Optional QR code scan to link session to user account
2. **During Session**: Real-time recording with no user intervention required
3. **Post-Session Notification**: Push notification when replay is ready (typically 5-15 minutes after session)
4. **Replay Access**: In-app access to personal video library of all sessions
5. **Editing & Sharing**: Tools to trim, enhance, and share clips to social media
