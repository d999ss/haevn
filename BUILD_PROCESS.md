# Haevn App Build Process

This document outlines the complete build process for the Haevn iOS application, including continuous integration, deployment pipelines, environment management, and quality assurance procedures.

## Build Pipeline Overview

The Haevn app uses a comprehensive build pipeline that ensures code quality, testing coverage, and reliable deployments across different environments.

```

## 1. Development Environment

### Local Development Setup

Developers work in a standardized environment to ensure consistency:

- Xcode 14.0+
- Swift 5.7+
- CocoaPods 1.11.0+
- SwiftLint for code quality
- Git for version control

### Branch Strategy

We follow a modified GitFlow workflow:

- `main`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Integration branch for features
- `feature/*`: Individual feature branches
- `release/*`: Release preparation branches
- `hotfix/*`: Emergency fixes for production

### Pre-Commit Hooks

Local pre-commit hooks enforce:

- SwiftLint validation
- Unit test execution for modified components
- Proper formatting
- No debug code in commits

## 2. Continuous Integration

### CI System

We use GitHub Actions for CI/CD, with workflows defined in `.github/workflows/`:

- `ci.yml`: Main CI workflow
- `nightly.yml`: Nightly builds and tests
- `release.yml`: Release process

### CI Workflow Stages

#### 1. Code Quality Checks

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow snippet
code-quality:
  runs-on: macos-latest
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Install SwiftLint
      run: brew install swiftlint
    - name: Run SwiftLint
      run: swiftlint --strict
```

- SwiftLint validation
- Code formatting checks
- Static analysis
- Dependency vulnerability scanning

#### 2. Build Process

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow snippet
build:
  needs: code-quality
  runs-on: macos-latest
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Install CocoaPods
      run: pod install
    - name: Build for testing
      run: xcodebuild -workspace Haevn.xcworkspace -scheme "Haevn Debug" -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 14 Pro' build-for-testing
```

- Clean build
- Resource compilation
- Code signing verification
- Build artifact generation

#### 3. Automated Testing

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow snippet
test:
  needs: build
  runs-on: macos-latest
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Run Tests
      run: xcodebuild -workspace Haevn.xcworkspace -scheme "Haevn Tests" -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 14 Pro' test
```

- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- UI tests
- Code coverage reporting

## 3. Environment Management

### Environment Configuration

The app supports multiple environments:

1. **Development**
   - Development API endpoints
   - Debug logging enabled
   - Mock services available
   - All feature flags accessible

2. **Staging**
   - Staging API endpoints
   - Limited logging
   - Real services with test data
   - Controlled feature flag access

3. **Production**
   - Production API endpoints
   - Minimal logging
   - Real services with live data
   - Feature flags controlled by release management

### Configuration Management

Environment-specific settings are managed through:

1. **XCConfig Files**
   - `Configuration.debug.xcconfig`
   - `Configuration.staging.xcconfig`
   - `Configuration.release.xcconfig`

2. **Environment Variables**
   - API endpoints
   - Service keys
   - Feature flag defaults

3. **Firebase Remote Config**
   - Dynamic feature flags
   - A/B test configurations
   - Remote settings

## 4. Build Variants

### Debug Builds

- Debugging symbols included
- Verbose logging
- Developer menu enabled
- Performance monitoring
- Mock data options

### Staging Builds

- Limited debugging
- Crash reporting
- Analytics with staging tag
- TestFlight distribution
- Staging backend services

### Release Builds

- Optimized for performance
- Minimal logging
- Full analytics
- App Store distribution
- Production backend services

## 5. Automated Deployment

### Fastlane Integration

We use Fastlane to automate the deployment process:

```ruby
# Example Fastfile snippet
lane :beta do
  ensure_git_status_clean
  increment_build_number
  build_app(scheme: "Haevn Release")
  upload_to_testflight
  slack(message: "New TestFlight build available!")
end
```

### TestFlight Deployment

- Automated builds triggered by merges to `develop`
- Internal testing group for daily builds
- External testing groups for milestone releases
- Build notes generated from commit messages

### App Store Deployment

- Triggered by release branch creation
- Automated screenshots generation
- Metadata preparation
- App Store Connect submission
- Review monitoring

## 6. Code Signing and Provisioning

### Certificate Management

We use fastlane match for certificate management:

```ruby
# Example Fastfile snippet
lane :certificates do
  match(type: "development", readonly: true)
  match(type: "appstore", readonly: true)
end
```

- Certificates stored in private Git repository
- Automated provisioning profile generation
- Consistent signing across team members
- CI system integration

### Provisioning Profiles

- Development profiles for team members
- Distribution profiles for TestFlight and App Store
- Automated profile installation
- Expiration monitoring and renewal

## 7. Build Artifacts

### Artifact Generation

Each build produces:

- `.ipa` file (iOS app package)
- `.dSYM` files (debug symbols)
- Build logs
- Test reports
- Code coverage data

### Artifact Storage

- CI system storage (short-term)
- S3 bucket (long-term)
- Organized by build number and git commit
- Retention policies based on build type

## 8. Quality Gates

### Pull Request Checks

PRs must pass:

- Build verification
