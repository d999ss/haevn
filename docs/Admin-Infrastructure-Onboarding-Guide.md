## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Integration Challenges

| Issue | Potential Causes | Resolution Steps |
|-------|------------------|------------------|
| Failed API connections | Network issues, invalid credentials | Verify network connectivity, check API key validity, confirm endpoint URLs |
| Data synchronization errors | Schema mismatches, timing issues | Compare data models, adjust sync frequency, implement retry logic |
| Booking conflicts | Race conditions, cache inconsistency | Implement proper locking mechanisms, reduce cache TTL, add conflict resolution logic |
| Payment processing failures | Gateway issues, configuration errors | Verify payment provider status, check account settings, test with sandbox transactions |

### Administrative Challenges

| Issue | Potential Causes | Resolution Steps |
|-------|------------------|------------------|
| Access permission issues | Incorrect role assignment, system bugs | Verify user roles, check permission matrices, clear cache if necessary |
| Reporting discrepancies | Data lag, calculation differences | Compare raw data sources, check reporting timeframes, verify calculation methods |
| Notification delivery failures | Communication service issues, invalid contact info | Check notification service status, verify recipient information, test alternate channels |
| System performance degradation | Resource constraints, inefficient queries | Monitor system metrics, optimize database queries, scale resources if needed |
