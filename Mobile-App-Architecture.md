# Mobile App Architecture

## Overview

The Haevn iOS app is built with a modern, scalable architecture designed to support the complex feature set while maintaining high performance, reliability, and code maintainability. This document outlines the architectural patterns, key technologies, and implementation strategies used throughout the mobile application.

## Architectural Pattern

### MVVM + Coordinator

The app follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern with a Coordinator layer for navigation management:

* **Model**: Core data structures and business logic
* **View**: SwiftUI views responsible for rendering UI
* **ViewModel**: Presentation logic and state management
* **Coordinator**: Navigation flow and dependency injection

This architecture provides clear separation of concerns, testability, and scalability as the app grows.

## Core Technologies

### UI Framework

* **SwiftUI**: Primary UI framework for declarative interface building
* **UIKit Integration**: Bridging for specialized components not yet available in SwiftUI
* **Combine**: Reactive programming for asynchronous events and data streams

### Networking

* **URLSession**: Foundation for network requests
* **Combine Publishers**: Reactive wrapper around network operations
* **Protocol-oriented API Clients**: Type-safe API interfaces

### Data Persistence

* **Core Data**: Primary persistence framework for complex relational data
* **UserDefaults**: For simple preference storage
* **Keychain**: For secure credential storage
* **FileManager**: For local file operations including video caching

### Dependencies

* **Swift Package Manager**: Primary dependency management tool
* **Key Dependencies**:
  * Kingfisher: Image loading and caching
  * Lottie: Animation rendering
  * Firebase: Analytics and remote config
  * Stripe: Payment processing
  * HLS Player: Video playback

## Module Structure

The app is organized into feature modules, each with its own dedicated directory and clear boundaries:

### Core Modules

* **HaevnCore**: Foundation types, extensions, and utilities
* **HaevnUI**: Shared UI components and design system implementation
* **HaevnNetworking**: API client and networking infrastructure
* **HaevnAuth**: Authentication and user management
* **HaevnPersistence**: Data storage and caching

### Feature Modules

* **Booking**: Session discovery and reservation
* **FlowState**: Video recording and playback
* **Membership**: Subscription management and benefits
* **Crews**: Social and community features
* **Retail**: E-commerce and product catalog
* **F&B**: Food and beverage ordering
* **Wallet**: Payment methods and transaction history

## Data Flow

### Unidirectional Data Flow

The app implements a unidirectional data flow pattern:

1. **User Actions**: Captured by SwiftUI views
2. **Intent Handling**: Processed by ViewModels
3. **State Updates**: State changes published to views
4. **UI Updates**: Views react to state changes

This pattern ensures predictable state management and easier debugging.

### State Management

* **Published Properties**: Primary mechanism for reactive state updates
* **Environment Objects**: For global state accessible across the view hierarchy
* **State Restoration**: Persistence of UI state across app launches
* **Memory Management**: Careful attention to retain cycles in Combine pipelines

## Navigation System

### Coordinator Pattern

* **AppCoordinator**: Root coordinator managing the main tab structure
* **Feature Coordinators**: Dedicated coordinators for each major feature
* **Navigation Actions**: Protocol-based communication between ViewModels and Coordinators
* **Deep Linking**: Centralized handling of external URLs and notifications

### Navigation Types

* **Tab-based**: Primary navigation between major features
* **Stack-based**: Hierarchical navigation within features
* **Modal**: For focused tasks and temporary workflows
* **Custom Transitions**: Specialized animations for key user journeys

## Offline Support

### Offline-First Approach

* **Local Caching**: Persistent storage of critical data
* **Optimistic Updates**: UI updates before server confirmation
* **Conflict Resolution**: Strategies for handling sync conflicts
* **Background Sync**: Automatic synchronization when connectivity returns
* **Offline Indicators**: Clear UI feedback about connectivity status

## Performance Optimization

### Rendering Performance

* **View Composition**: Breaking complex views into smaller components
* **Lazy Loading**: Deferred loading of off-screen content
* **Memory Management**: Careful handling of large assets like images and videos
* **Background Processing**: Heavy tasks moved off the main thread

### Network Optimization

* **Request Batching**: Combining related requests
* **Caching Headers**: Proper use of HTTP caching
* **Compression**: Minimizing payload sizes
* **Prefetching**: Anticipating user needs for smoother experiences
* **Retry Logic**: Smart handling of network failures

## Testing Strategy

### Test Pyramid

* **Unit Tests**: For business logic and ViewModels
* **Integration Tests**: For feature workflows
* **UI Tests**: For critical user journeys
* **Snapshot Tests**: For UI component consistency

### Testing Tools

* **XCTest**: Primary testing framework
* **ViewInspector**: For SwiftUI view testing
* **Combine Testing**: Custom extensions for testing asynchronous code
* **Mock Service Layer**: Protocol-based mocking of network services

## Security Measures

### Data Protection

* **At Rest**: Encryption of sensitive local data
* **In Transit**: TLS for all network communications
* **Keychain Usage**: Secure storage for credentials and tokens
* **App Transport Security**: Enforced HTTPS connections

### Authentication

* **Token Management**: Secure handling of authentication tokens
* **Biometric Authentication**: TouchID/FaceID integration
* **Session Expiry**: Proper handling of token lifecycle
* **Secure Logout**: Complete cleanup of sensitive data

## Accessibility

### Implementation Strategy

* **Dynamic Type**: Support for user-preferred text sizes
* **VoiceOver**: Comprehensive screen reader support
* **Reduced Motion**: Alternative animations for users with motion sensitivity
* **Color Contrast**: WCAG AA compliance for all text and UI elements
* **Keyboard Navigation**: Full support for external keyboards

## Localization

### Multi-language Support

* **String Catalogs**: Externalized text resources
* **Format Localization**: Date, time, currency, and number formatting
* **Right-to-Left Support**: Layout adaptation for RTL languages
* **Dynamic Content Sizing**: Accommodating text length variations

## Analytics & Monitoring

### User Analytics

* **Screen Tracking**: Monitoring of screen views and engagement
* **Event Logging**: Tracking of key user actions
* **Funnel Analysis**: Conversion tracking through critical flows
* **Session Metrics**: Duration, frequency, and retention data

### Performance Monitoring

* **Crash Reporting**: Automated collection of crash logs
* **Network Monitoring**: Tracking of API performance
* **UI Responsiveness**: Monitoring of frame rates and rendering times
* **Memory Usage**: Tracking of memory consumption patterns

## CI/CD Pipeline

### Continuous Integration

* **Automated Builds**: On every pull request
* **Test Automation**: Running the full test suite
* **Static Analysis**: SwiftLint and other code quality tools
* **Dependency Scanning**: Security checks of third-party code

### Continuous Delivery

* **TestFlight Distribution**: Automated beta deployments
* **Internal Testing**: Alpha builds for team testing
* **Phased Rollouts**: Gradual production deployments
* **Release Automation**: Streamlined App Store submission

## Future Architecture Evolution
