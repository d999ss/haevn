# Design Collaboration Guidelines

This document outlines the collaboration process between the development team and the Bttr. Design Team for the Haevn iOS application.

## Bttr. Design Team Role

Bttr. Design Team is the dedicated design partner responsible for all design aspects of the Haevn app project. Their comprehensive role encompasses:

- Creating and maintaining the cohesive visual identity and design system for Haevn
- Developing user experience flows and interaction patterns across all app features
- Producing high-fidelity UI designs, prototypes, and animation specifications
- Conducting user research and usability testing
- Iterating designs based on development feedback and technical constraints
- Providing design QA during development phases
- Ensuring accessibility standards are met in all designs
- Collaborating on App Store visual assets and marketing materials

Bttr's expertise in surf culture and lifestyle applications makes them an ideal partner for translating Haevn's brand values into a compelling digital experience that resonates with the target audience.

## Design System

The Haevn Design System, created and maintained by the Bttr. Design Team, serves as the single source of truth for all visual elements and interaction patterns in the app.

### Design System Components

- **Color Palette**: Primary, secondary, and accent colors with accessibility considerations
- **Typography**: Font families, sizes, weights, and line heights
- **Spacing System**: Consistent spacing units and layout grids
- **UI Components**: Reusable interface elements with states and variants
- **Iconography**: Custom icon set with consistent style and meaning
- **Animations**: Motion principles, timing functions, and transition patterns
- **Illustrations**: Custom illustration style guide and usage guidelines

### Accessing Design Assets

All design assets are maintained in Figma and can be accessed through the following channels:

- **Figma Projects**: [Haevn Design System](https://figma.com/file/haevn-design-system)
- **Design Token Repository**: [GitHub - Haevn Design Tokens](https://github.com/haevn/design-tokens)
- **Asset Catalog**: Integrated directly into the Xcode project

## Collaboration Workflow

### Design to Development Handoff Process

1. **Design Exploration**
   - Bttr. Design Team creates initial concepts based on feature requirements
   - Weekly design reviews with product and development teams
   - Iterative refinement based on feedback

2. **Design Specification**
   - Detailed UI designs with component specifications
   - Interactive prototypes for complex interactions
   - Accessibility annotations and considerations
   - Responsive layout guidelines for different device sizes

3. **Development Handoff**
   - Designs published to Figma with development-ready specifications
   - Design QA checklist provided for each feature
   - Technical feasibility review with development team
   - Asset export in appropriate formats (PDF, SVG, PNG)

4. **Implementation Support**
   - Regular design review sessions during development
   - Bttr. Design Team available for questions and clarifications
   - Collaborative problem-solving for technical constraints

5. **Design QA**
   - Bttr. Design Team reviews implemented features against designs
   - Visual regression testing for UI consistency
   - Interaction and animation review
   - Feedback provided through standardized design QA reports

### Communication Channels

- **Slack**: #haevn-design channel for day-to-day communication
- **Figma Comments**: For specific design feedback and questions
- **Weekly Sync**: Design and development alignment meeting (Wednesdays, 10:00 AM PST)
- **Design Review Sessions**: Scheduled as needed during implementation phases

## Design Request Process

When new design work is needed:

1. **Request Initiation**
   - File a Design Request ticket in JIRA with the "Design" label
   - Include feature requirements, user stories, and technical constraints
   - Specify timeline and priority

2. **Design Planning**
   - Bttr. Design Team reviews and estimates the request
   - Design tasks added to sprint planning when appropriate
   - Timeline confirmation and resource allocation

3. **Design Delivery**
   - Designs shared via Figma with notification in Slack
   - Presentation of design solutions in relevant meetings
   - Documentation of design decisions and rationale

## Design Review Guidelines

### For Developers Reviewing Designs

- Focus on technical feasibility and implementation considerations
- Consider edge cases and state management
- Evaluate performance implications
- Provide specific, actionable feedback
- Ask questions about unclear interactions or specifications

### For Designers Reviewing Implementation

- Compare against design specifications systematically
- Test on multiple devices and orientations
- Verify animations and transitions
- Check accessibility features implementation
- Provide visual examples when identifying discrepancies

## Design-Development Rituals

- **Design System Updates**: Monthly review of design system components and implementation
- **Design Sprints**: Quarterly focused sessions for major feature explorations
- **UI Audit**: Bi-monthly review of implemented features against design specifications
- **Accessibility Reviews**: Regular checks with accessibility experts

## Conflict Resolution

When design and technical requirements conflict:

1. Identify the specific constraint or limitation
2. Explore alternative solutions collaboratively
3. Prioritize user experience while respecting technical boundaries
4. Document compromises and rationale for future reference
5. Escalate to product management if consensus cannot be reached

## Design Version Control

- Design versions are tracked in Figma with clear naming conventions
- Major design changes are documented in the project changelog
- Design decisions and explorations are archived for reference
- A/B test variations are clearly labeled and results documented
